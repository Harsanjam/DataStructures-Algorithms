Lab4 by Harsanjam Saini (Id: 501055402) completed on March 9, 2022

My custom state machine was:
A F E
B C F
C E G
D G H
E B A
F D F
G A H
H C B
 
The starting state is A 

The stateDiagram is included as a jpg file in the folder

Instructions for user to test code:

1. To delete a state use the command 'd' and then followed by a state name with a space between them. (example: d H)

2. to print the entire state pattern, simple type 'p'. (it is case sensitive)

3. to exit the program, simply type 'q' to quit. (it is case sensitive)

4.Enter a command (0 or 1) to switch state.

5. to change the path of the current state first type 'c' then type if you want to switch 0/1 nd finally indicate the name of the new state. Please note that it works by have a blank space between the 3 commands. (Example: c 0 G) 

Notes:

In my code the no command, one/zero command, print command and change command fully work.
The delete command can be invoked by typing the letter 'd' followed by the name of the state to delete.
The garbage command was not completed.

however I do have an idea on how it could be implemented:

--> Create an array of states that are in pointer form.

-->	Then create a global static character array filled with dummy variable that can be used as a control to track garbage and non-garbage letters.

--> This array would be filled by recursively going through all the states and if they are reachable, their char name replaces the dummy var in the control array.  

--> If they are garbage then change the pointer array names to 'z'.

--> To check for garbage, simply iterate through the control array and if it isn't 'z' then it is not garbage.

--> Have a global static character array filled with dummy vars that are used to track deleted states.

--> It fills with garbage names when garbage is called.

--> If the pointer array has name 'z' it is replaced with ' ' so it can't be seen.
